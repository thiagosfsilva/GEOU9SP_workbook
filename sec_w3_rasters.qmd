# Week 3 - Working with raster files

This week, we will...

## ILOs covered

1.  Understand the structure of spatial data and choose appropriate data types and models for storing and representing it;

2.  Obtain and assess the quality of spatial data from online and offline sources and produce new spatial data using computer and field methods;

3.  Create map visualisations that adhere to cartographic principles and can be easily and unambiguously interpreted by the non-specialist public;

4.  Plan and execute GIS analytical steps to solve spatial problems successfully;

## What will you learn

For every week, we will list the main theoretical and practical learning goals. Use these as a 'checklist' to gauge your learning for each week. If you don't feel confident you have learned any specific topic, then revisit the week's material!
